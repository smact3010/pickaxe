# Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

#   One of the accepted principles of good desing is the elimination of unnecessary duplication.

# 5.1
# Inheritance and Messages

#   Inheritance allows you to create a class that is a refinement or specialization of another class. This class is called a subclass of the original, and the original is a superclass of the subclass. People also talk of child and parent classes.

#   The child (subclass) inherits all of the capabilities of its parent (superclass) class - all the parent's instance methods are available in the instances of the child.
